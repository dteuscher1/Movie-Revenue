Packages used for analysis
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(Amelia)
```

Read in the data
```{r, warning=FALSE}
movie_train <- read.csv("train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = c("", NA))
movie_test <- read.csv("test.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = c("", NA))
head(movie_test)
movie_data <- bind_rows(movie_train, movie_test)
```


```{r}
str(movie_data) # Well some of these variables don't look like fun; belongs to collection, genres, production companies, production countries and so forth
```


```{r}
# Plots of numeric variables
ggplot(movie_data, aes(x=popularity, y = revenue)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) + xlim(0, 300)
ggplot(movie_data, aes(x=runtime, y = revenue)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
ggplot(movie_data, aes(x=budget, y = revenue)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)

# Plot of how many values are missing
missmap(movie_data, col = c("red", "navyblue"))
```

Categorical variables
```{r}
# The categorical variables will be more difficult to deal with 
# Belongs to a collection
sum(is.na(movie_data$belongs_to_collection))
nrow(movie_data)
# It seems that most movies don't belong to a collection, so I'm going to create an indicator variable to specify if a movie belongs to a collection or not
movie_data <- movie_data %>% mutate(Collection = ifelse(is.na(belongs_to_collection), 0, 1))

# Original Language
sum(movie_data$original_language == "en")

# Most of the movies are English, so I'm going to add another indicator variable to specify if the original language was English or not
movie_data <- movie_data %>% mutate(English = ifelse(original_language == "en", 1, 0))

# For the others, we are likely going to have to use regular expressions to get information out of it I believe
```
