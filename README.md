# TMDB Box Office Revenue Prediction Project

This repository includes exploratory analysis and predictive modeling for the TMDB Box Office Prediction Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/overview).

The .Rmd file where the analysis was done is available, while an HTML document, `Movie-EDA.html`, has also been created that includes the code and output as well. A notebook was created on Kaggle for this competition and can be found [here]().

The goal of this competition is to determine the box office revenue of different movies. All movies are trying to maximize revenue, especially movies that spend a lot of money on production. Movies are often considered a success or failure based on the success at the box office, so if it is possible to accurately predict the box office revenue based off of certain factors, it can be beneficial to production companies when approaching different movies in the future. 

The training set includes 7398 movies from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDB). Each movie has a unique id and includes information such as cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, release dates, among other variables. The `revenue` column contains the revenue, which is what is trying to be predicted. The test set includes 4398 movies and includes all of the same variables that are included in the training set besides revenue.
